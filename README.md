## To calculate the delay for a single "Beat":

- Divide the BPM of your mix by 60. That will give you a 1/4 note value.
- Halve the 1/4 note value (or divide by 2) and you get the 1/8 value.
- Halve the 1/8 note value (or divide by 2) and you end up with the 1/16 value.
- To calculate Dotted Value multiply the calculated delay value by 1.5
- To calculate the triplet value multiply the calculated delay value by .667
